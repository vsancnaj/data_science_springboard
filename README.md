## Overview
The `data_science_bootcamp` repository is a collection of my projects and work completed during my data science studies at the Springboard bootcamp. This README file serves as a guide to help navigate through the materials in this repository.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into several directories, each containing materials on a specific project or topic. The following is a brief overview of each directory:

* `london_housing_prices`: This directory contains a Google Colab notebook with the code used to manipulate the data and create graphs for my first data science project. 


<!--project2: This directory contains materials related to my second data science project, including the project proposal, data sources, code, and report.
lecture_notes: This directory contains notes taken during lectures and workshops at the bootcamp.
exercises: This directory contains exercises that can be used to reinforce the concepts presented in the materials.
